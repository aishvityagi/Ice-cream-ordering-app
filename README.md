# Ice-cream-ordering-app
This Java project, Ice Cream Ordering App, is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to select and customize ice cream cones, sundaes, and cold drinks, and automatically generates an order summary and final bill with taxes.

Key features include:
Category Selection: Users can choose between three categoriesâ€”ice cream cones, sundaes, and cold drinks.
Dynamic Options: Depending on the category selected, the appropriate options (scoops, flavors, sundae sizes, or drink sizes) become available.
Order Customization: For cones, users can select the number of scoops (up to three) and choose different flavors for each. Sundaes and drinks offer size selection.
Order Summary: The app keeps track of multiple orders, displaying them in a summary panel with an updated total price.
Tax Calculation: GST, CGST, and SGST (all 5%) are calculated automatically and added to the final bill.
Bill Generation: After placing the order, a detailed bill is generated showing individual items, subtotal, taxes, and the final total. The bill is displayed both in the order summary and in a separate window.
This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for GUI design, event handling through ActionListeners, and structured bill generation using string manipulation and tax calculations. It's a great showcase of basic event-driven programming, user interface design, and logical structuring in Java.
